# 2714 " After spending some years at NYUAD, I've come to understand what it is about this place and being here that often drives us crazy. I have lost count of the number of times I've heard people say that coming here has been great but they've actually become less confident than what they used to be in high school. After interacting with many, many people and having the deepest of introspections I have come to realize the following: 1. You can't be everything. You can and should play another octave, but you can't play every octave. Find one or two things you like and enjoy doing and use the university's resources to become better at it. I know that people who are highly regarded here are those that are writing for the Gazelle, doing well in classes, running 4 SIGs, doing an internship AND are good at sports but a. you don't know what they're truly going through to be able to do all that b. it's still better for your own sanity that you do the amount of things YOU are comfortable with. 2. I've never seen a more resourceful university and yet I've never heard of a place where so many people are collectively depressed/feeling low ALL THE TIME. To have a good time here, you have to learn to be comfortable with other people's successes. Anytime you feel intimidated by someone's success you have to ask yourself, would I even be interested in doing that in the first place? You then need to take that energy and put it into the FEW things that you have chosen to do/love at this university. 3. What is the point of making it to NYUAD when you're not even living in the moment? Go to the gym, have some quality free coffee, go under the palms, go on a karak date, read a book for fun. Please, you will never be in your early 20's again. You're more than just a student. Remember, opportunities will come and go, time will only go. 4. Being surrounded by so many amazing people is hard. But the whole point of this place is to break the vicious cycle of surviving on the quick and comforting validation of being better than others. Co-existence is challenging, feeling vulnerable is difficult but it's still better to be pushed and inspired by crazily talented people than to feel superior amongst those that put little to no effort in what they do. You are here to learn and grow and BECOME something. Becoming is a process. Be open to changing. Go back to your roots once in a while. Set goals and try to accomplish them but don't forget to look back and see how far you've truly come in life. If you are not happy with the progress you've made thus far, there is NO guarantee that you will be happy with what you are seeking to achieve in the future. I don't know if I should've simply contained these feelings and not written an essay about it, but I know I am not alone in feeling this constant pain of being inadequate when in fact I am really not. I hope you protect your self-esteem fiercely because that's the one thing you'll take with you when it's time to leave. <3 <3 "

The way you just understand me and have helped me grow for the past few months we’ve been texting just makes me wanna move in with you and literally have your babies. You are making it so hard for my thoughts to stay pure I’m not complaining, I’m just wondering what I did to deserve your attention ...... please be patient with me when I doubt you cause the guy before you just shattered my view on boys and relationships. But my therapist told me that there are a few unicorns out there.... and I’m starting to think you are mine. Please don’t ask me out yet though, I am too scared to get into another relationship rn, but I am working on healing. It’s okay if you can’t wait, cause it’s unfair for me to ask..... but when I’m fully healed past this, I swear I will love the heaven out of you. Yours truly, "

# 3962 " Heart = MacBook Like = Windows "
# 3961 " Recently, I've noticed more friendships end because people have come to expect too much of their friends. While we should be there for our friends in their time of need, it's imperative to remember we're not required to provide them therapy. Yes, it's important to care about and offer support to the people we love, but we are under no obligation to constantly listen to them and help them work through their issues. We're also not required to be there for them all the time, especially if it places an unfair mental burden on us. These are hard times and it's difficult to get away from our heads amid the physical restrictions, but that doesn't mean we should expect our friends to take on our mental loads. If you're going through something and your friend doesn't want to talk about it, that doesn't mean they don't care about you. It could also mean that they just don't have the mental capacity to take on your problems when they're probably facing their own. Even if your issues seem much worse than theirs, they don't view it that way because their issues will continue to exhaust them, leaving them little mental room to deal with yours. Be understanding and empathetic! "

# 3954 " "Whoever was talking about the ""flexers"" at NYUAD: Maybe my experience is quite different because you may just be in some chats I'm not in or something, but I've had the exact opposite experience. Compared to my high school the people here just seem both more intellectually well-rounded and more humble. I see a more healthy willingness to admit to actually being stressed and struggling as opposed to just piling on classes and extracurriculars (which we really can't anyway see credit limits) and pretending like nothing's wrong and you never fail or get stressed out about anything. But honestly if you think that every single instance of people talking about what they've done or whatever is ""boasting about their greatness"" you may just have some deeper insecurities that you should talk to someone about solving rather than posting on these pages. Sure maybe some people (me included sometimes) need to do a better job realizing that no one gives a shit but honestly I feel as if NYUAD fosters a healthier environment relating to academic egocentrism and impostor syndrome than a lot of other places.

# 3953 " I love that taking exams online allows me the ability to cry without feeling weird. I’ve taken MANY tests in person that made me want to burst into tears but for obvious reasons I held back those tears. I was taking my chem test recently and I just started crying because it was hard and I was super stressed out about it. When I stopped crying I quickly figured out the answer to the problem I was stuck on, and I ended up getting a good grade on the test. So moral of the story: cry on your exams!! "
# 3952 " What I don’t understand is how science homework and tests could be flagged for plagiarism. Like bitch, how many different ways are there to use a formula and come up with a numerical answer. “The graph you came up with matches other students’ perfectly”. Yeah, I fucking HOPE it does. "
# 3951 " Uhm...why are there so many “flexers” at NYUAD? Like, it makes me wanna punch someone in the head. I’m a freshman, and I’ve never seen such a toxic amount of people (at least in my class) that like to boast about their greatness. What and who are you trying to prove it to? The reason it makes me angry, is that somehow, these people, who continuously boast, think that they are better than you or anyone else in the room (a zoom call or a gc, cuz that’s all we can afford rn) BECAUSE they are the only ones overt about that. And if you’re asking yourself why so many people at our university have the impostor syndrome and there is this toxic environment of egocentricity at our uni, check your words before you are gonna flex your another achievement, when no one clearly inquired about that.

# 3948 " to my friends, when i find the courage to finally open to you about my mental health struggles, and how i feel like i am in the darkest, most hopeless place possible, to the point i am considering dropping out, please do not trivialize the situation. Don't tell me "we all deal with stuff", i.e. "I'm just overreacting", don't tell me "I'm not sad when I eat", and certainly don't say all these and expect me to continue to open up to you about my situation or any situation in my life, or expect me to consider you my friends. Such words are extremely hurtful. And this is just one way you have let me down as friends. I did not say this to your face not because I am afraid to, but because I have come to realize that talking to you about my struggles gets me nowhere, it's a waste of my time. I just wanted to tell you this in case someone else decides to open up to you guys. P.S.-I'm in need of new friends, so if anyone needs. "

# 3931 " Freshman appreciation spree 1)Yerkebulan Imanbayev, I don’t personally know you but I can tell from my gut that you’re an extraordinary human being. You seem super goofy, fun to be around, and extremely intelligent, and I’ll definitely want to hang out with you IRL when we can be campus. 2) Jianna Jackson, you have such an incredible energy and you seem so supportive and sweet. I can tell you’re a real life angel. 3) Yaghsha Mir, I think you are under appreciated, thank you for updating the Noticeboard everyday, I don’t know how you keep up. You are amazing. 4) Elen Assyrian, you are extraordinarily approachable and you make people soo comfortable being around you, and I want to emphasize on how incredible this is given the virtual setting. Also, you seem so kind and pure, and like you’re the kind of person who never speaks ill of anyone. 5) Alex Najm, you give “cool person” vibes, and someone with whom we can speak of anything free of judgment. Also, my gut tells me you can be trusted blindly. 6) Aya Adib, you have such eloquence and charisma when you talk. I’d love to see you vlog, you could talk about the different type of pickles there exists and I’d still be entertained. 7) Ishika Menrai, you are the OG appreciated person of the class of 2024. I will never forget what you did at CW1, you deserve to be famous. Someone at The Gazelle should write an article about you. You’re AWESOME, thank you for the pins I wish I could write an appreciation post for all 500 of you amidst this time, (that’s actually a challenge I’ll try to fulfill over the Fall Semester). Unfortunately I cannot do it all at once, but just know that small actions such as texting something nice on the group chats, responding in private to help with certain questions, answering to Instagram Stories or just turning on your cameras in class makes me notice you and appreciate you, and I’m sure this is the same for many others. I want to thank you for being so supportive and so sweet even though there are thousands of miles between some of us. I appreciate you all even though I only personally know like 4 of you. Lovingly, Magnolia (I decided that was gonna be my mysterious name) "

At least have the god damn dignity to respond to me with a simple 'hi' back. I'm so tired of the fucking isolationist culture of this school, especially now that Corona has kicked in. Like legit, collaboration is still a thing, you have a voice that can be used. So many people with their mikes muted and cameras off, like if you don't plan to participate just don't fucking come to lecture/discussion. Im so heated with having reached out to these god damn anti-social fucks in my breakout rooms, and they just ignore what I say. Professors and TAs please encourage people to talk or something, else DON'T use breakout rooms. I'm so tired of being sent to these awkward af breakout cells where I legit will just wait until we get back to the main session, cause I could use some help, but no one wants to talk.

I tried the CDC but they are useless as they've always been since the start of this university. Signed, A very lost and hopeless falcon "

Also, the fact that you are literally so healthy and lowkey ripped and high key sensitive...... I just wanna book a plane ticket rn and come give you the biggest hug and shower you with kisses. The way you just understand me and have helped me grow for the past few months we’ve been texting just makes me wanna move in with you and literally have your babies. You are making it so hard for my thoughts to stay pure I’m not complaining, I’m just wondering what I did to deserve your attention ...... please be patient with me when I doubt you cause the guy before you just shattered my view on boys and relationships. But my therapist told me that there are a few unicorns out there.... and I’m starting to think you are mine. Please don’t ask me out yet though, I am too scared to get into another relationship rn, but I am working on healing. It’s okay if you can’t wait, cause it’s unfair for me to ask..... but when I’m fully healed past this, I swear I will love the heaven out of you. Yours truly, "

# 3961 " Recently, I've noticed more friendships end because people have come to expect too much of their friends. While we should be there for our friends in their time of need, it's imperative to remember we're not required to provide them therapy. Yes, it's important to care about and offer support to the people we love, but we are under no obligation to constantly listen to them and help them work through their issues. We're also not required to be there for them all the time, especially if it places an unfair mental burden on us. These are hard times and it's difficult to get away from our heads amid the physical restrictions, but that doesn't mean we should expect our friends to take on our mental loads. If you're going through something and your friend doesn't want to talk about it, that doesn't mean they don't care about you. It could also mean that they just don't have the mental capacity to take on your problems when they're probably facing their own. Even if your issues seem much worse than theirs, they don't view it that way because their issues will continue to exhaust them, leaving them little mental room to deal with yours. Be understanding and empathetic! "

# 3954 " "Whoever was talking about the ""flexers"" at NYUAD: Maybe my experience is quite different because you may just be in some chats I'm not in or something, but I've had the exact opposite experience. Compared to my high school the people here just seem both more intellectually well-rounded and more humble. I see a more healthy willingness to admit to actually being stressed and struggling as opposed to just piling on classes and extracurriculars (which we really can't anyway see credit limits) and pretending like nothing's wrong and you never fail or get stressed out about anything. But honestly if you think that every single instance of people talking about what they've done or whatever is ""boasting about their greatness"" you may just have some deeper insecurities that you should talk to someone about solving rather than posting on these pages. Sure maybe some people (me included sometimes) need to do a better job realizing that no one gives a shit but honestly I feel as if NYUAD fosters a healthier environment relating to academic egocentrism and impostor syndrome than a lot of other places.

# 3953 " I love that taking exams online allows me the ability to cry without feeling weird.

I was taking my chem test recently and I just started crying because it was hard and I was super stressed out about it. When I stopped crying I quickly figured out the answer to the problem I was stuck on, and I ended up getting a good grade on the test. So moral of the story: cry on your exams!! "

I’m a freshman, and I’ve never seen such a toxic amount of people (at least in my class) that like to boast about their greatness. What and who are you trying to prove it to? The reason it makes me angry, is that somehow, these people, who continuously boast, think that they are better than you or anyone else in the room (a zoom call or a gc, cuz that’s all we can afford rn) BECAUSE they are the only ones overt about that. And if you’re asking yourself why so many people at our university have the impostor syndrome and there is this toxic environment of egocentricity at our uni, check your words before you are gonna flex your another achievement, when no one clearly inquired about that.

Don't tell me "we all deal with stuff", i.e. "I'm just overreacting", don't tell me "I'm not sad when I eat", and certainly don't say all these and expect me to continue to open up to you about my situation or any situation in my life, or expect me to consider you my friends. Such words are extremely hurtful. And this is just one way you have let me down as friends. I did not say this to your face not because I am afraid to, but because I have come to realize that talking to you about my struggles gets me nowhere, it's a waste of my time. I just wanted to tell you this in case someone else decides to open up to you guys. P.S.-I'm in need of new friends, so if anyone needs. "

# 3931 " Freshman appreciation spree 1)Yerkebulan Imanbayev, I don’t personally know you but I can tell from my gut that you’re an extraordinary human being. You seem super goofy, fun to be around, and extremely intelligent, and I’ll definitely want to hang out with you IRL when we can be campus. 2) Jianna Jackson, you have such an incredible energy and you seem so supportive and sweet. I can tell you’re a real life angel. 3) Yaghsha Mir, I think you are under appreciated, thank you for updating the Noticeboard everyday, I don’t know how you keep up. You are amazing. 4) Elen Assyrian, you are extraordinarily approachable and you make people soo comfortable being around you, and I want to emphasize on how incredible this is given the virtual setting. Also, you seem so kind and pure, and like you’re the kind of person who never speaks ill of anyone. 5) Alex Najm, you give “cool person” vibes, and someone with whom we can speak of anything free of judgment. Also, my gut tells me you can be trusted blindly. 6) Aya Adib, you have such eloquence and charisma when you talk. I’d love to see you vlog, you could talk about the different type of pickles there exists and I’d still be entertained. 7) Ishika Menrai, you are the OG appreciated person of the class of 2024. I will never forget what you did at CW1, you deserve to be famous. Someone at The Gazelle should write an article about you. You’re AWESOME, thank you for the pins I wish I could write an appreciation post for all 500 of you amidst this time, (that’s actually a challenge I’ll try to fulfill over the Fall Semester). Unfortunately I cannot do it all at once, but just know that small actions such as texting something nice on the group chats, responding in private to help with certain questions, answering to Instagram Stories or just turning on your cameras in class makes me notice you and appreciate you, and I’m sure this is the same for many others. I want to thank you for being so supportive and so sweet even though there are thousands of miles between some of us. I appreciate you all even though I only personally know like 4 of you.

At least have the god damn dignity to respond to me with a simple 'hi' back. I'm so tired of the fucking isolationist culture of this school, especially now that Corona has kicked in. Like legit, collaboration is still a thing, you have a voice that can be used. So many people with their mikes muted and cameras off, like if you don't plan to participate just don't fucking come to lecture/discussion. Im so heated with having reached out to these god damn anti-social fucks in my breakout rooms, and they just ignore what I say. Professors and TAs please encourage people to talk or something, else DON'T use breakout rooms. I'm so tired of being sent to these awkward af breakout cells where I legit will just wait until we get back to the main session, cause I could use some help, but no one wants to talk.

# 3903 " Following up on the herpes post: if you don't have herpes you probably read that and though ew lol, and if you do have it, then you probably felt relieved to finally see it mentioned for some purpose other than to make fun of people with the disease. There is so much stigma around herpes that when I developed a cold sore for the first time and googled the symptoms, I refused to believe that herpes was the cause. In fact, one of the most common searches related to herpes is ""causes of cold sores that isn't herpes."" That's how scared people are of the word herpes. And spoiler alert: there is no other cause for cold sores. Also the tremendous stigma related to herpes is entirely disproportionate to the severity of the disease. It's truly is nothing more than either a cold sore on you mouth or tiny little sores in the genital area. It doesn't kill or maim anyone. It's simply temporary discomfort. Despite that people talk about it like it is the epitome of poor hygiene and low standards, as though having the disease is a character flaw. Its laced with classist stereotypes and is the punch line of many jokes. People with herpes are often too embarrassed to even tell their closest friends because they're afraid it will change how their friends see them. Even the fact that so few people liked that previous post speaks to how scared people are that someone might think they have herpes. If you're making jokes about herpes, think about what you're implying, or how your friend who has it and is too embarrassed to tell you feels when they hear that. (Let's face it, even if you don't have herpes you certainly have a friend who does and feels like they can't confide in you) Let's un-normalize making fun of medical conditions. It's 2020 and we know better than that. Btw, if you ever get sores around your mouth or little itchy bumps or blisters down there, congrats you're one of us. "
# 3902 " So.... the WHO says almost 70% of people under the age of 50 have herpes. Ya. Like 70. Most ppl dont even know they carry it cause it has literally no affect on their lives.

# 3900 " I'm helping a potential NYUAD student with their common app essay (don't worry, they're writing all the stuff themselves I'm just correcting spelling and grammar and giving advice on structure) and I swear to god at this point I'll be so sad if he doesn't go somewhere good because he is incredible. He's been through so much crap, not least from living in a very conservative part of a very poor country, and he's done so much work for a huge variety of social causes. He's resilient, intelligent and humble and any university that doesn't want to take him on is quite frankly fucking idiotic. As a native English speaker, it's broken my heart to see students both here and back home who are clearly smarter than I could ever hope to be struggle and get fewer opportunities because they don't speak English as well or with a nice accent. The person I'm helping has become my friend and I am so so proud of him and everything he has done. It's really put into perspective all of the incredible individuals I have come to know and befriend here, and I hope upon all hopes that he can join those ranks. To all prospective applicants: never forget just how much you are worth, how far you have come and how much work you have done. Never ever let your background, socio-economic status, gender, race, sexuality, level of English proficiency, or literally anything else stand in the way of you working hard and striving to achieve your goals. You can do it, I believe in you and there will be a place for you at NYUAD if nowhere else. I'd be proud to get to know you and have you in this community. "
# 3899 " I’m glad to see everyone coming back to campus but I’d like to give a special shoutout to the students who stayed on campus throughout the entire summer and literally witnessed the campus go from nearly completely restricted in terms of activities movements, events and gatherings to the reopening of sit down dining, more shuttle times etc. Before we see the 800+ students fill D2 once again, I’d like to give this appreciation posts to the OG summer survivors.

# 3896 " "I was very anxious when I found out how much freedom to move around campus we have upon arrival before quarantine and I wanted to emphasize the importance of taking maximum precautions during this time. For the love of god everyone, pls pls follow the safety recommendations. Students coming from around the world is probably one of the bigger risks of outbreaks that we will face on campus and this time during which we can move around freely is perhaps the biggest risk of the arrival/quarantine period. During this time we will be able to move through closed AC-ed spaces that are shared by students and staff, and some areas will be frequented by many arriving students in a few days time - like C2, elevators, storage hallways. It is super important to wear a mask at all times, regardless of whether there is anyone around, sanitize our hands frequently and keep a physical distance (which in a normal semester is something unimaginable as we arrive in large groups from airports and remeet friends). If any airborne virus particles are released they can easily be spread around a larger area thanks to AC. Please remember that it's only (K)N95 masks that protect the person who wears it from getting infected, while all surgical and fabric masks are meant to prevent the spreading of particles that the person who wears it releases. Most staff members and workers on campus usually wear surgical masks only (at least back in may) so it's on each of us to make sure they are protected! Plus, they won't be quarantining like us so there is a greater risk of the virus spreading without anyone knowing about it. Safe travels <3" "
# 3895 " Hey! In light of all this happening, I just wanna say that since many of us are coming back to campus for the Fall semester, the sudden increase in population density on campus will definitely place higher risks on all of us. So PLEASE adhere to all the rules including but not limited to proper quarantine, wearing face masks PROPERLY, social distancing and gathering of no more than 6 people in a room, etc. Also, PLEASE don’t go to downtown Abu Dhabi or Dubai if ABSOLUTELY necessary. COVID is not a JOKE. Although the city is gradually opening up, we still see hundreds of new cases per day. The risk is still there. Keep in mind that if we have a certain number of new cases from our community, the school will act in the way that priorities our health and safety, which might be CLOSING DOWN the school and sending students back home. Let us cherish the opportunity of spending the next semester on such a warm, loving campus and guard our safety TOGETHER!!! "

# 3886 " I really miss my roommate from my study abroad time in NY. He must have trusted and be very comfortable around me, because he always left his wallet sitting on his desk in our room. Since he seemed to go out to eat a lot, he also carried around a lot of cash with him (probably around $40 on average when I check). But wait.. "when I check"? Yup. Maybe once every two weeks, if I saw that he has $50+ dollars in his wallet at the moment, I'll quietly and sneakily steal a $10 or $20. He never noticed because I've done it very gradually, and I procured a little over $200 of his money during my one semester abroard. With it, I bought chipotle, go out for coffee, etc. while spending HIS money and didnt feel guilty about it, and I never got caught The great thing about this is that he never suspected that I did it, even if he noticed. He's just too stupid, overloaded with work, and disorganized to care or notice He has a job too, and considering how low-effort his job is, it's not like he deserves the money he makes. #eattherich "

# 3879 " Imma tell you a secret: people look so hot wearing a face mask. Like no joke I go from nerdy awkward girl to mysterious fucking enigma with huge eyes. I can see why masks are a fashion trend in Korea. Go wear a mask so that you can both be on campus and look cute while you’re there "
# 3878 " The care react really annoys me. What is it even supposed to mean? If you want to show support you can use like or heart or even sad react. Care react makes no sense. I have never used it and never intend to "

# 3876 " I’m 21 and not ready to date. I don’t want to, I have a lot to work on and I want to do it alone. I wish people would stop asking me to date. It’s ok to be single, not everyone needs someone. Please stop pressuring or judging your single friends for not dating or hooking up. There’s so much more to life than dating someone. Maybe I will get there one day, but right now is not my time. "

I don’t read books from beginning to end... I skip chapters and I come back to them... sometimes I open a random page and begin reading... I have books I never finished but I don’t know what pages I haven’t read... some of those are fiction "
# 3872 " People at NYU Abu Dhabi want to come back to campus, but half of ya'll are back in your home countries going to bars and parties without wearing a mask. Now imagine this but with 800 people on campus going to Saadiyat Beach Club and Yas Mall. No wonder why the school doesn't want a full student body back on campus this fall. These are the same people shitting on the US for mishandling the virus, but who still go out without masks and who don't take the virus seriously. You're just as bad as the Americans. "
# 3871 " I think a lot of people here assume that people that disagree with them politically (especially on the right) have bad intentions. That they’re racist or they don’t care about the poor, that they’re ignorant, etc. I think this makes the environment for any political discourse very toxic and it’s one of the aspects I like least about NYUAD.

# 3867 " So I've been talking to a really cute and wholesome Taiwanese girl (thanks tinder passport). I told her I could read and speak Chinese when my banana ABC self actually can't (esp not traditional) since she doesn't know much English and I've been using Google translate to decipher the text. The thing is she's recently been starting to send voice messages and her mandarin is accented so Google translate doesn't translate it completely right and that's led to some awkward conversations. I've even asked my parents on some of the stuff said (they were actually happy to help since they always wanted me to date someone from China/Taiwan) but if she starts talking about sexual stuff then its gonna be even more awkward. I bought duolingo though so hopefully I can learn fast enough. Wish me luck.

So hang in there y'all LDR Unless you are a stupid egotistic ignorant arrogant horny idiotic buttwit who can't keep his pants closed for other girls and goes out here playing people while his girlfriend stays loyal back home hoping that he's staying faithful and even gives his butt two more chances after cheating on her ...... then, Screw you :) "
# 3860 " My boyfriend obviously has a small penis and I really don't mind that but what makes me uncomfortable and a little tilted is that he acts like it's enormous. "You like having every inch of my enormous cock in you...don't you?" It's like 4 inches. "
# 3859 " So, I’m a Christian but throughout the whole semester I feel like Christianity is not really making it for me. I tried to go to church and regain my faith but the more I do it the more it seems to falter. Instead I’ve been reading the Qur’an and exploring Islam and feel driven towards it, but quarantine has made it so difficult for me to continue this. I found a copy of Ihya Ulum Al Din and I’ve been reading from that, and I keep finding this type of literature (and lol, I think I’m going crazy cause I’m taking this as a sign). It’s really weird for me cause I feel very lost and I want to make up my mind on what’s best for me, and if I do decide to convert I want to do it as soon as possible to start learning the prayers. Isolation is really not helping me right now and I’m also worried of what might happen if my family finds out I’ve been thinking about this when I go back home. I just wanted to get this out of my chest. "

# 3851 " My boyfriend and I have sex quite frequently, but he's so gentle with me in fear of hurting me (which I really appreciate and is so sweet of him) which makes it hard for me to fully enjoy sex. I honestly just want to be degraded, choked until I can't breathe, and fucked like a ragdoll. "
# 3850 " Sometimes when I text my girlfriend I need to have a dictionary/thesaurus page open cause she frequently uses words that could be used in Harry Potter spells and that everyone had to painfully memorize for SATS before they removed them. Like seriously who the fuck uses words like "harangue" or "obviate" in everyday text conversations??? She's not even an English major either so idfk what is her deal… "
# 3849 " For the first time in my life, I want to live. I always hoped, but never believed that antidepressants would work this well. I just need everyone to know that you are worth living for, and life is worth living for. "
# 3848 " Is it normal that I completely feel nothing and I have nothing to look forward to at the moment? I cant find a job anywhere, no grad school in September, broke up with my boyfriend because of long distance shit.. I workout, hang out with my friends, read but all of what’s happening is wearing me down and I don’t know what to do. "
# 3847 " During the quarantine I've gotten a Disney plus subscription and I've been watching the usual, Star Wars Clone Wars season 7, the Mandalorian, Onward, the Nightmare Before Christmas, etc. But after I finished all those, I decided to give Hannah Montana a try since I saw it a bit with my sister when I was small. And I'm really ashamed to admit this as a twenty year old guy, but I love it. This stuff is better than the Big Bang Theory. It's so hilarious yet it also has some kinda mature themes. I feel like a ten year old girl again. Oh wait, I've never been a ten year old girl. Oh well, time to sing Best of Both Worlds to myself for the hundredth time. "
# 3846 " You know, sometimes it’s hard to meet genuine people at NYUAD. There’s so many cocky bastards who can’t shut up about what they’ve done. Where’s the personality? Where are the profound conversations? Yeah, cool, you have never gotten a B in your life and you’ve been involved in some hella cool stuff, but is there room for some humane laughter? I understand this time in our lives is so important. Working to find a career. A career where we’ll slave under American Capitalism. Some of ya’ll gotta chill and bathe in the moment sometimes. When we start working for the rest of our lives, you’ll regret not making more REAL connections. Maybe I’m stupid for saying this, but this craving for authenticity while I’m constantly surrounded by false faces all the time is so suffocating. "

# 3844 " I want to give a special shoutout to my boyfriend that has been my constant support, motivation, and strength in the past few months! I've been the luckies girl to find in you love and friendship and I don't know if I will be able to ever express my gratitude properly. "

# 3831 " Looking at seniors yesterday made me so sad. Seeing all of them together so happy, fulfilled, laughing and enjoying themselves on the highline was just so wholesome. But it also made me realise that we will have to leave this place that I never want to stop calling home. Each passing day, I remember how much of a heaven this place is for me, but that only reminds me how little time we have here. So let's appreaciate it! Class of 2020, wish you all the best in your future endeavors! Go out there and make us proud! "

# 3826 " Congrats on graduating class of 2020! The culmination of hardwork for the past few years was not a waste. Its just unfortunate to be in the situation we're in right now. I get it. I graduated back in 2009 during the last recession. It was difficult for anyone to find a job. People were getting laid off right and left. Asset values were plummeting. The world was uncertain that we would recovered from what was the worst recession since the great depression. What I found important was the fact that I never gave up. You will get multiple doors closed on your face, but you need to look ahead and make sure you keep your chin up and keep trying. While your dream job might be pushed forward on your timeline, it doesn't mean you won't land it. Stay focus and and if you're determined enough, you will get through this stronger. "
# 3825 " Freshman Alpha, getting to know you has been the highlight of my semester. You're so kind and considerate and just a ray of sunshine. The world is just a better place with you in it. Can't wait to hopefully see you next sem! -An admirer. "

So many countries in the continent haven’t closed their borders and the continent has the lowest cases of covid on the planet soooo?? We need to get home too and there “not being enough people from Africa for them to fly back home” is not an escuse cause there’s plenty of Africans ready to go back to their countries NOW. "
# 3823 " I wanted to thank two of my professors this semster, and many more professors; if you were lenient with deadlines and understanding, thank you. I am not talking about not caring about my assignment, I just mead that you were understanding and accommodating. Because of you I was able to complete my work to the highest standard, and had fun doing it. Furthermore, thank you to the Professors who just took it easy on us recently without compromising the class. Reducing the workload a bit doesn't take away from what we are doing. Also shame on you to professors who close doors to students, making us feel like we cannot reach out if we need to. You make a stressful life worse. "

# 3818 " Studying for finals week has been rough thanks to some other not-school-related factors. But when I am studying, sometimes my girlfriend's face comes to mind and my studying quality increases easily by 50%. I feel as though I can remember the content easier and I'm enjoying my time studying. She doesn't permeate my thoughts so that I'm distracted, but just enough to remind me that someone out there wants me to do well on my finals, but even if I don't do so hot, she'll still cuddle with me later. I'm so lucky to be in a relationship with this amazing person! "
# 3817 " I hope we can go back to campus in the fall i miss sleeping on a bed "
# 3816 " Courses are all online (which makes me want to fucking scream), I may be stuck at home with no friends for the rest of the year...I would almost rather kill myself than go through the next year. Why are we still pretending this is alright and it's the new normal and we just have to accept it. It's not and I won't. I tried. I can't. Wish I could just fall asleep and wake up when it's all over "
# 3815 " Dear Seniors, Daniel Kahneman's (who won the 2002 Nobel Prize) research on how we remember things suggests that we naturally remember emotional peaks and endings of experiences, rather than evaluating them holistically as a total sum of good or bad things that happened. When I read about this, I worried that the hugely sad situation now of commencement and Maassalama being cancelled and your final semester being largely taken away from you would cloud how you remember your four mad, beautiful years at NYUAD. Please remember that even though the grand ending and celebrations got away from you, nobody can ever take away all the adventures you've been on, all the relationships you've built, and all the memories you've made in your time as an NYUAD student. As Coach Dicce said to us just before we graduated, in 5 years' time we won't be running to hug our paper degrees, but the lifelong friends we see coming round the corner. When you have a moment, I would urge you to sit down and list out your three favourite moments from every single semester of the past four years. Look back over your instagram feed from sophomore fall break. Find the first post you ever made in your class facebook group. Spark up an old group chat from that rogue J-term you had. Send people photos of your favourite moments with them, or if you have a diary, reread it. However you archive things, please take the time to look back across all the crazy things you've got to do while you've been here, so that your memories of NYU Abu Dhabi for the next 5, 10 and 50 years will be ones of all the amazing things you did and the people you did them with, rather than this sad blip at the end. All the best, and welcome to your new family of alumni. "

# 3808 " My closest friend at NYUAD was studying away this semester and she is currently at home so I haven't actually seen her in months, but luckily we only got closer while being physically apart. I just wanna show how grateful I am to have met such a wonderful person who has been such a huge emotional support during these tough times. Love you and miss you lots! "
# 3807 " Honestly, StuGov has nothing on these PSA elections. Six different people DM'd me already asking me to vote for their candidates, like damn you guys have mad outreach "
# 3806 " Shoutout to Dana for putting up with our depressed asses. I swear I know more than 4 friends who always book her office hours to talk. Shes so comfortable to talk to and vent to (and also cry to, ive done it multiple times) Only recently knew she lost her grandfather and I feel so shitty for complaining about my minor worries. Just wanted to put this one out there so we remember to thank such people. I know so many of you rely on staff members to get things off your chest and they’ve been offering constant support no matter what they’re personally going through. Comment below moments you were grateful for staff members. Let’s make this a reminder to send a quick thank you to those people and remind ourselves of this caring community we have "
# 3805 " "I just realised that as we ask for extensions for finals, and projects due to corona to our professors, so do our professors to admin. Can you imagine any professor being like: "" Dear Vice Chancellor Westerman, I hope you are well during these uncertain times. Due to the current online learning situation, on behalf of professors XXX we would like to ask for an extension on the assignment grading deadline for XXX ...""" "
# 3804 " I’m one of those people that usually has a black tape on top of their laptop cam, but I’ve been feeling so alone in quarantine that not only do I no longer put the tape on, but I now like to believe my FBI agent is chilling, watching me switch between working on an essay to bursting into tears, back to the essay, and to then bursting into singing and dancing all in the span of an hour. I like to believe I make him smile, and he’s secretly falling in love with me but can’t reach out because it would be unprofessional, and so he continues to spend his days looking after me from a distance. I just finished a dance number and he better be out there laughing and dancing with me. "
# 3803 " Thank you Ray for making the movie 100 Countries Tell a Story!! I saw so many familiar faces and started to miss all my friends in NYUAD! And it's such a great initiative during the hard time of COVID-19. Big hug to you <3 "

# 3794 " Here is the list of things I've done so far in quarantine : . "
# 3793 " Can we all please agree to frequently do reunions after graduation? And alumni meetups with other classes? I cant imagine marrying someone who didn't have the nyuad experience but also i dont think we're old enough yet. like can we all have a huge meetup when we're ready to 'settle down'? I think the average person outside nyuad doesn't have the same thinking level and I cant wait to see nyuad guys/girls when they're 30. I feel like they'll be killing it! "
# 3792 " PLZ READ: Guys please check up on your friends. Please let them know you genuinely care about them. Especially if they aren’t on campus. If you haven’t been talking much, even a small text can go such a long way. These are very difficult times, especially for people that are alone right now, or are the type of people that need affection. Even just hearing that you are thinking of them or are there for them can help so much. They need you more than you know. "
# 3791 " I just had a dream where I was playing CoD but instead of a normal game, I was defending my place in class from waitlisted students. "
# 3790 " FUCK EVERYONE WHO IS IN A 3 PERSON SUITE. You're being so fucking selfish, if you don't have someone to room with then just choose a room that already has someone living in it. It is so unfair to people who already have roommates but can't room with them anymore because there are 0 empty doubles. We're at 99% occupancy this semester, trust me you're not playing the system and you will NOT end up in a dingle. Please reconsider. "
# 3789 " I'm a fourth year CS major who doesn't know how to code and at this point I'm too afraid to ask "
# 3788 " Do you know what really hurts about this quarantine? The opportunity to know people (in person) is lost. Heck, the opportunity to strengthen my current relationships is also lost. Especially my friendship with my floormates. Just being with them in the hallway, the laundry room, made me genuinely so happy. My dorm was like a little family for me. Don't get this twisted-- I love my home and my parents. I'm grateful that I'm safe at home right now in the middle of this huge pandemic. It's just that I never thought missing people would hurt so much. As I go to bed at night and close my eyes, I can't help but smile, all the memories being played on rewind. I sound melodramatic, don't I? Haha, sorry, but if there's one thing that I'd like to confess, it's that loved freshman year at NYUAD. And I never thought I'd say this but, the people made this year the most special for me. "

Like bruh.. can I keep doing NY classes online for my major when I’m back in AD or do you think we could ask for more variety/specialized courses? cause at this point I’m not majoring in my field, I’m just majoring in liberal arts "
# 3781 " America! You working on it? Or should I have a contingency plan "
# 3780 " In times like these, my professor just called me out in front of the whole class when I and a few others asked him to decrease the workload of the course. We weren’t even asking him to do anything unfair since he’s cramming all the quizes and assignments that we missed in the last 2 months into just 3 weeks. How is this fair? He also accused us of “lobbying against him to change course requirements” I mean come on man, what is he doing ? On top of that, the others didn’t have the guts to speak up in front of the professor when he was calling us out. Makes me very sad. "
# 3779 " All these posts about people shooting their shots. Seriously people should stop enforcing the idea that you need to be in a relationship to be happy. Yes relationships can bring a lot of happiness and peace but that's only when it's a good one and when you're with the right person. It's about time we start appreciating being single. Being single is not equivalent to loneliness. The fact that you're bored in these times doesn't mean you should be telling yourself that being in a relationship will make you feel better. Learn to maximize your singleness. Most of us end up in bad relationships causewe don't even know how to be single. We don't even know how to love ourselves. How do you expect to love someone else and have the person love you when you don't even love yourself. Bro... Sis... Enjoy being single while it lasts. Take the time to develop on yourself as an individual. Out your energy into achieving your goals instead of using it feeling sorry for yourself for being single. After this whole loxkdown, take yourself out on a DATE!! YES Take yourself out on a date. The world around us will call it loneliness, I call it maximizing your singleness! Relax and wait for the right person. Go into a relationship cause you're you know you're ready to stay with that person. Don't shoot unnecessary shots in the name of being scared of lonliness and end up even destroying friendships that could have been long lasting ones!! I feel like we should start offering relationships classes to people cause naahh.. We really are getting ourselves into shit and hurting ourselves too many times.. "
# 3778 " This quarantine really teaching you who your real friends are. it's so interesting to see who messages/checks up on you, and who doesn't give a shit. "
# 3777 " ENGINEERING & SCIENCE FACULTY..I do not understand you people. People are struggling... like proper struggling and you think people are chilling.. And have time for your hard ass exams??

Im scared outta my fucking mind thinking about what could happen to all of us. for the love of god please stay inside you do not want to go through this.. Who can i talk to for help? "
# 3775 " Reasons why I'm refusing to self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1- There's no way the whole world is going to self-isolate so why should I? One person can't make a difference. 2- It's unhealthy to stay out of the sun and enjoy the company of fellow humans. 3- It's expensive. 4- Self-isolationists shouldn't force their beliefs on others. They should live and let live. I mean, I don't force THEM to go out and socialise. 5- I just enjoy the feeling of being with friends in the highline. 6- It doesn't harm other people who are out, enjoying themselves, anyway. 7- You say it's immoral...? Morality is subjective and going out feels right to me. 8- It's a cultural thing. In my country, socialising is the norm. My ancestors did it. 9- I know people will die but it's the circle of life. As long as they die humanely and with respect, it's all OK. After all, they'd die eventually, anyway. 10 - If it came to a choice of going out and socialising or starving to death on a desert island, which would you choose? 11- We evolved from apes...apes are social creatures. 12- If people didn't die, the world would be overpopulated. 13- There are better ways to promote self-isolation. The in-your-face approach from most self-righteous self-isolationists just puts normal people off the idea. Recognise any of these arguments? This is the sort of shit that Vegans hear every day. "
# 3774 " To my engineering, science and math professors: I am struggling. My family is struggling. My parents work in high-risk professions. I can’t breathe or think of anything else. I am stressed, I am crying all the time. You go on like the semester is the same - assigning assignments and exams like it’s all that matters - that it doesn’t matter that my loved ones are testing positive, or that I am absolutely devastated and constantly stressed about them. The last thing I want to do is attempt such a tough assignment, or study for your tough exams. I just want to breathe. To my engineering, science and math professors at NYUAD, I wish you would be kind. At the very least, I wish you would understand. But you don’t, and you go on like everything is okay. I’m sorry to say, nothing is okay. And you are making it worse. "

# 3767 " I just want to share a heartfelt thank you to VC for being so brutally honest and open about things that she definitely DID NOT need to share during the forum today. The attacks on the staff today was not meant from the entirety of the class. Some students still appreciate you, staff! You're doing great, thank you for taking care of us!!! "
# 3766 " I am a senior who attended the admin forum. I just want to say that I hope after it we can take a step back, calm down, and not add pressure or stress to each others lives. We cannot focus our energies on the wrong people and things. I've seen how stressful it has been for commencement role holders. They are under much pressure from different groups of people in our community (students, faculty, administration). Please let's take a step back and tell them we appreciate them. Lujain, Prince, Zain, Rawan, and Ekin, we appreciate you and will support you no matter what <3 "
# 3765 " i think its ridiculous to say that admin are suppressing us. they care so so much about the welfare of students. i studied away in nyc last year and nyuny is literally a corporation. i think the admin have handled this crisis with students' best interests at heart...what other school in the world is letting students stay on campus, doing so much programming for students' mental health and leisure, reaching out to every student, giving every study away student 1300 dirhams? the admin does so much for us and it disheartens me to see that the minute one thing doesn't go your way, you are so quick to say the admin does nothing, the admin suppresses us. Rather than engaging in a dialogue, you have been attacking each other and attacking the student government representatives who respond to every irrelevant tag of their names on facebook posts, who put so much time and effort into improving the quality of our life at nyuad. As an underclassmen, some members of the class of 2020 have been my role models and it saddens me to see everyone attacking each other in their last weeks at our school. I understand how difficult it must be to lose your commencement and I fully support you advocating for a better solution, but I urge you to consider how you want to be remembered and to be kinder to each other. "
# 3764 " Guys, I have been thinking lately about our classes being online and how it is challenging all of us and, maybe uniquely, our faculty. I haven't observed many classes but in my classes, almost all of us switch off our cameras during the lectures. While I understand that we may prefer to do this for a multitude of reasons, I think it would help our professors if we kept them on. I have just been trying to imagine how it would have felt for me if I was speaking to a blank screen on my powerpoint for other people on the other side of the world expecting them to be there. I think keeping the cameras on will just make the classes more live and maybe help our profs feel like humans too in these hard times we are all going through. Thanks I am going anonymous because I think what I say is more important than who I am "
# 3763 " You are needed. Yes, you. You are wanted. Even though it doesn't seem like it at the moment, things will get better. Please take the time to breathe. It's okay if you're struggling to learn online or forgetting to turn in assignments or feeling stressed about school. Just remember to take care of yourself and don't be too hard on your performance. Try your best, but above all your health should be your first priority. Being alone all day and finishing those never-ending projects is tough, especially when help comes at odd hours, but do things at your own pace. Give yourself the space to think and believe in what you can achieve. At home, you may feel strange or be reminded of things you wanted to forget. Take the opportunity to forgive, to develop, to embrace. And summer? You may have lost your plans, missed out on time with friends, forgone new career experiences, but have courage to keep trying. Keep sending those emails, keep applying. Don't be afraid to reach out for the help of others. Keep going. You are not alone. "

# 3753 " My roommate smells so bad that when my friend walked into our place, he dry heaved. He has basic hygiene habits, but for some reason he wont wash his clothes. It smells so bad that i would honestly prefer if it was just shit or urine. It smells like nato and fermented soybean paste pissed on each other and fucked, then vomited in each others mouth. the smell is beyond cheese, its fermented and straight aged. The pants smell the worst, a aged blend of shit, piss, and jizz stains. He absolutely will not wash his clothes because he doesnt think they smell. We’ve tried candles, febreze, rubbing alcohol. Nothings killed the smell. My other roommates and I are worried that we”ll start smelling like it too. We are actually thinking bout calling Resed director about it, he wont do anything about it, and if we wash it without him knowing, he”ll prob burn our clothes. He has threatened multiple times, and i believe him. We had someone come to fix our sink, and the minute he walked into the bathroom, he gagged, and then went to serco office cus he “forgot something.” The guy came back with a face mask. "

# 3749 " I am amazed at the sense of entitlement shown in these times. Granted, the campus is small and we are all going to run into each-other or hang out we are a closed community, fine. Have large gatherings throw parties like I can’t stop you and that’s not the issue. But when you think you, and your wanting a cig or to hang out walking around campus and you get mad at the police for telling you you’re supposed to be inside? Not everyone is mad about this just somehow shocked you have to abide by the law. There is an argument to be made that NYUAD campus is a community and the whole campus is basically a shared dorm but still. Stay off the street at the government imposes curfew. These are the measures being taken to try to ensure we don’t end up like the US or Italy or any other place that has been strongly affected by this virus. This is to keep the guards shifts easier and safer, to try to protect people as you seem to think you are the only people on earth. Everyone else has to abide by this. Why do you think you are exempt? This is a hard time and we want to make it good, but you a Re not the only ones suffering. We are not taking the necessary precautions and isolating ourselves so people like you can have fun because there are less people out. Just stay in and watch Netflix like everyone else. You are not above any other human. "

# 3741 " Dear students - concerned prof here. During these crazy times we live in, the university has been given a lot of latitude. Unlike people elsewhere, we can still go outside and walk the Highline. However, this is in jeopardy since you have collectively failed to maintain social distancing. I see you everyday in large groups in close proximity outside. Please just walk alone, exercise alone, and stay 2m away from people on the Highline. If you don’t, we will all be forced to stay inside. Please don’t screw it up. "

His face is so peaceful and sometimes he snores softly when he’s really tired (which is adorable). When I’m working or using my laptop in bed next to him he always hugs my leg because he wants to cuddle. And when I get into bed ready to sleep, I kiss him on the forehead and tell him I love him, and sometimes he whispers it back in his sleep. And I’m super needy so I’ll whisper for him to spoon me and he’ll unconsciously reposition himself and throw him arms over me and hold me to sleep. I love you so much baby!!!!! "

# 3737 " "Another freshman here. I couldn't agree more with post #3736. Seniors, you'll really be missed. Reading the email about the commencement broke my heart because you guys deserve the best and biggest goodbye. You were there for us since Day 1 and in a blink of an eye, this place became home because of how welcoming and warm you guys were. You were always there to help us out, give us advice, and show us that things will work out in the end. You set a great example for us. Thank you for being so nice and supportive and going through great lengths to give back to our community (shoutout to Prince, Doovaraha, and Ruth.. among many other incredible seniors). It all means a lot much more to us than you might think. I know it's a bit early, but I just wanted you to know the impact that you've had on us. Thank you Class of 202‪0. We will miss you so much. "
# 3736 " To all of the Seniors graduating in this crazy time: I’ve only been at NYUAD for a semester and a half but looking at the group of seniors we have on this campus makes me think about how much potential there is to do great things here. You're such AMAZING and TALENTED people and I’m really sorry I didn’t get a chance to meet all of you. But those I have met have shown me that you are always ready to openly help out freshmen who feel lost or just want advice on everything from picking a major to just living the life of a college student. Experiencing class with you guys was so eye opening, your all so smart and insightful that I feel like I’ve already learned so much in this past year from class discussions. But I’ve learned just as much from the class of 2020 outside of academia too, even just by watching you guys. I’ve learned to be comfortable with this place and comfortable with myself (a process I’m still going thru but Ik I can get there), because you all seem so comfortable and happy here and you all have your own personalities that you project so proudly. Ik this place is gonna be a much bumpier ride than I’m making it seem, but I also know that, by looking at your class, I’ll grow and develop so many great friendships. So thank you guys for leading by example. Ik this is random (especially since there’s still a little over 2 months left of the semester) but seeing the email about commencement made me realize that you guys might need smth, no matter how small, to smile about rn (I have a sister in her senior year of uni too and seeing her at home just so upset about everything is killing me) so I thought I’d show you guys in a little way just how much your appreciated on this campus. You welcomed us with open arms so I just wanted to say goodbye with that same level of friendship, so thank you guys for helping NYUAD feel like home so quickly and thank you for showing us what we can become at this amazing place. I sincerely hope you guys get a proper send off and that you all achieve what you want in your future class of 2020. We’ll miss you "

# 3729 " To Laura Karpauskaite, You are a sight for sore eyes! Truly, you are one of the most amazing people on this campus and I wish that we had more time together before the end of the semester.

# 3725 " I'm too scared to tell this to anyone and too scared to ask in person, but I know that I need help immediately. I tried sending a post a few weeks ago, but it never got through. Things have gotten worse since then and now I can't get myself outside this cycle. My boyfriend has been abusing me and I can't tell anyone. He makes it seem like everything is okay around his friends but when they are gone, he pressures me into having sex with him and quiets me when I say no. I don't know who to turn to but I vaguely remember being told about seeking help when this happens during marhaba. I just never paid attention because I never thought it would be me looking for such help. Please help me..please please please. "
# 3724 " I feel really disappointed. I'm living on campus with all the facilities and my parents back home are struggling. My dad is not getting paid as the restaurants are closed and/or not getting customers. Ik writing here doesn't help but I just wanted to share this to ease my pain. Hope everything returns to normal. May God give us strength to overcome this stressful period. "
# 3723 " Whenever I have sex with my girlfriend, and she is on top, I look at the shelf adjacent from my bed. On this shelf is a black book with red letters that says “Probability - Pitman.” When I see this book I think back to when I was in STAT class, and I immediately am able to not cum for as long as I want. I try to recall every possible fact about every distribution in that book. This kills almost all sensitivity down there. Switching off between this and coming back into the moment when I’m starting to go soft, let’s me fuck for as long as she wants. She thinks I’m a beast, but Pitman is really the one rocking her shit.

This time should be about bringing people together so if someone has improved your life in some way during this time, let them know! "
# 3716 " Look, I agree with the left on most things, but we fucking suck at talking to people who don’t agree with us. I asked a girl what her spirit animal was, and she hit me with the “oof” because just using the term is a faux pas. Okay, fine, well I disagree. I think it’s just too catchy. Care to explain why I’m wrong? Nope. She ghosted me. Why won’t anyone risk a single conflict for once to improve our society? In class few weeks back, we had a discussion on homelessness. The one guy who was brave enough to speak up and said “a lot of them are drug addicts, they should fix that first” was promptly crucified. Two people went up to him afterwards because they pounced too hard. He didn’t say much the rest of the class. I wish, oh I wish dearly I could just have a real conversation with someone who disagrees with me on many topics and knows why they think what they think. Don’t get that much at NYUAD. My opinions were only born here, not tested, not changed. "

# 3713 " I'm liberal but holy fuck the liberals at NYUAD make me embarrassed to be so. Literally people will say they're "open-minded" and "smart" but then say anyone who doesn't agree with them is brainwashed. A lot of the liberals here can't fathom a smart, educated, and kind person being a conservative; for them, it's either you agree with me or you're a dumb, terrible person. I can't believe people will stop being someone's friend for being a Trump supporter or conservative... If you look down on someone for having different views, you are seriously immature and arrogant.

# 3710 " I had - let’s put it as this - not the most exciting semester at nyuad last fall. My mental health was non-existent and I was constantly on the edge. Yet, through daily work beginning late december I was able to get my anxiety under control, increase the levels of my confidence and self-esteem to where they truly deserved to be, and now I am feeling happy and complete every day. I am so grateful to myself for not giving up during the darkest times and want to shout out to everyone struggling with their life and mental health: you are AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL for who you are, please keep going - I truly believe in you! Cheers <3 "
# 3709 " This is something quite small, but I get a warm, fuzzy feeling when my roommate comes into the room late in the night, and is courteous to be extra ninja-stealthy with his movement and voice. I sometimes "pretend sleep" to see this kind of shit and, I don't know, it makes you remember that you're still worth something in this big, ass world. The fact that if I didn't exist, he would be stumbling in and ricocheting against every furniture (he usually comes home drunk) possible. As someone who struggles with self-love, it's an unexpectedly precious act. It's also cute imagining this may be their behavior if you were an awaiting mother or father in the night. But since you are attending school as well, you empathize with their midnight shenanigans, seeing that this is "your" child trying to live their life, coming from the library, getting high, drunk, or laid--just trying to be a happy college student. Which makes you smile even wider. So thanks Roomie, for giving me these small moments that make the biggest difference. Thanks for helping me love myself. "

# 3701 " Seriously, take it from someone who's out in the real world, NYUAD people are some of the finest in the world. Not just academically, but on a human level, they truly are fantastic and one of a kind. "
# 3700 " I literally just want to cook food for my friends. Thats all, it makes me happy. A lot of times when I want to cook for my friends and I invite them over they're like "Oh its ok, I have food" or "No you should eat it". Thats not the point. I want to spend time with you and hang out, and I make good food so I want to share it. I often feel like I only see my friends when we study together, or at the occasional hangout, and its not their fault because this school is really busy and we all have a lot of work all the time. But when I invite you to eat my food its not me doing you a favor, its you helping me - letting me do something that makes me happy and spend time with my friends who I love. So for all you NYUAD folks out there, if your friend invites you over to eat their food, either say yes because it will probably make them happy, or come up with a better excuse like you're too busy with studying or already have plans. "
# 3599 " From a recent grad: Kids, this is a very useful advice. Go use the gym as much as you can and attend as many gym classes as possible because once you get out of the bubble you’ll be asked to pay a looooot of dirhams to join a gym or attend gym classes that are (to my understanding) of a lower quality than those at NYUAD.

Today I saw her and she made no mention either even when I dropped casual hints like “I am already 22 I can’t believe I am almost 1/4 of a century or do you want to get cake later to celebrate for fun” but she didn’t pick up on it and instead got mad at me for forgetting to bring her back her headphones she left in my dorm :( (She still hasn’t wished me happy birthday and I threw her such a big party and expensive dinner just two months ago for her own birthday).

# 3587 " I love school. There, I said it. It may well be the lamest and nerdiest thing I’ve ever typed, but I fucking love school. It’s not even so much THIS school, although the classes here and the wealth of knowledge from world-famous professors are bomb. I just really fucking enjoy learning in general. There’s just so many fun and interesting things humanity knows as a whole! And I’m an undisciplined sack of shit, so I don’t ever actually read shut on my own. The procrastinate-cram for exam cycle is still hell, of course, but I still have that tryhard student attitude going, and it’s like a familiar, comfortable hell. I kind of wish I could just attend school forever. That sounds... even weirder and pathetic. And obviously unrealistic. My impression is that grad school is actual fire and brimstone, and I’m not suited for research anyway, so this is my last tutorial stage before capital A Adulthood. Maybe I’m just scared of adulting. Life is pretty comfortable and stuff, I love the city.... What am I even gonna do after graduating? Work, hobbies/video games, rinse and repeat? That sounds awful. And it assumes I’ll actually get the job I want right out of college.... What else? I guess the next “stage” is finding a guy. How am I gonna date if I don’t even know how to find a date here and now?? What do I wanna do with my life?! I hope some of you guys have got stuff a little more figured out than me, haha. "

Do the work on your own. It's best for all of us if we stop feeling like we have some obligation to feign altruism and camaraderie. If it's anything but academics or job-related stuff, then yeah, I'm fine with helping people out if I have the opportunity. But with that kinda stuff, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there.

# 3580 " If you're reading this, I promise you things will get better. For the longest time at NYUAD, I was failing courses semester after semester. I was struggling to stay on track and at times I thought about dropping out. I hardly told anyone about my depression. I am a first-generation college student and I couldn't tell my parents I was failing when I was their dream. I couldn't tell friends I was failing because I did not want to be accused of "not working hard enough". However, this past semester was my first successful semester at NYUAD - I passed all my courses for the first time, things began to fall into place, I declared my major, I connected with my professors, and I found the girl of my dreams. She pushed me through it all, she wiped my tears when I felt low, she reminded me of my potential and kept me going. It made a difference to have someone, just one person, believe in me. She filled my heart with immense joy; the same heart that felt alone in this world for 2 years. Life slaps you in the face really hard sometimes, but I am here to tell you that whatever low you are going through in life right now- things will get better. "

# 3571 " Hi guys, on behalf of students of NYUSH I just want to put it out there to count your blessings every day. I don't necessarily mean just that you are healthy and safe, which is definitely of utmost importance, but also that you all are able to take normal college classes and carry your semesters forward at such a beautiful campus. We do not know when we will get the opportunity to head back as of yet, as classes will be held online for now beginning the 17th. For the students, faculty, and administration, this is an extremely testing time, especially when taking into account that seniors need to complete their capstones and semester in time to graduate. Without victimizing ourselves, this situation has taught all of us how the most unexpected of circumstances can take over our routine lives so easily, and put to light things we often unconsciously take for granted. This all goes to show how something seemingly small at first, an unprecedented virus, has touched our lives even though we are not suffering its effects directly. We are all fortunate to be alive and healthy unlike those in Wuhan who are risking their lives every day, many to fight corona to the core so this is all over soon. Most importantly, we've seen NYUSH come together more than ever before in a time of uncertainty and hardship, and are hopeful and positive that that will pull us through the term. I hope we realize that instead of blaming a nation and its people for this situation, we lift each other up instead of dragging each other down. While it is unfortunate that study aways had to lose the opportunity to experience Shanghai this term, we are thankful that they made the right decision to prioritize their safety and academics. While we don't know where this is taking us, there must be a reason for all of this and in the end, we will get there, even if we don't know when. We are frustrated, confused, disappointed, and anxious for our futures, but so thankful for the embraces of a global NYU community. "

It doesn't matter the style but nothing looks worse than someone who has clothes too small or too large for their bodily proportions. 2) Hair is insanely important. For god's sake, cut and style your hair. Get some gel and figure out the angles of your hair. Nothing is sexier than when a girl combs her hands through your hair and shivers go down your back. Personally, I like it when a guy's hair is shorter on the sides and longer on top. The top should be long enough (like 1.5-2 in) so I can run my hands through it/ grab something while we make out. 1.5-2in should also allow men to be able to style it with gel to look put together. 3) Glasses (if you have them) Find frames that make your face look angular. Women drool over the angled jawlines of celebrities, so find a pair that can emphasize either your cheekbones or your jawline. 4) Posture. Hold your shoulders back. This will open up your body and force your head to look up making you look more confident in your appearance and ultimately “sexier” -sincerely a girl who went to NYUAD to escape her 8-year-old brother, not to have to date men who look like him "

I had to go the bathroom like 10 times where it was literally just diarrhea, but that's not the point. I know that everyone who's lactose intolerant still drinks milk or diary products. If you don't, you're probably not a real lactose intolerant. And we keep drinking it even though we know it ends badly because we love it. We love milk and cheese and butter and ice cream and frozen yogurt and in n out smoothies. But when it comes to a cutie in the hallway or person that we just want to get to know better or ask out, we never act on it. Yet we always keep drinking copious amounts of milk. Maybe its time to start acting like the lactose intolerant idiots that we are and ask that friend or stranger or crush out. "

# 3541 " To all the ladies out there (I mean everyone else too but I'm just gonna focus on the ladies), I recently read an article that said that one of the problems women face in trying to get interviews/jobs is that women tend to only apply for positions where they feel almost 100% qualified whereas men are more likely to apply even if they didn't meet all the qualifications. Now, I understand that this is very general and vague (it cited a study but I didn't check details/numbers) and the same can go for everyone else too, but I wanted to point it out specifically for the ladies who might be down after fall recruiting (for certain majors) or finals, because I know a lot of other girls who this does apply to. Shoot your shot (at a job)! You've got nothing to lose! And if they reject/ghost you, don't feel bad! They're missing out on you!

# 3540 " Once in a while, my favorite song would play in D2 and I'd be super pumped. I know I could always play it on my phone and be equally excited, but having someone else unexpectedly play it for me is addictive. In the past, I've found myself crowding my playlist with meh songs along with my favorite one just so I could press shuffle and get the thrill of "suddenly" listening to that gem. That's what I think good sex is like. I know I could always tell my partner what I like/don't like, but where's the fun in that? It's more arousing when I hook up with someone and discover that, unbeknownst to me, they're also into the stuff that I am. This is why I like grammarly.

# 3496 " Let's see the student body's opinion on the printing cap. Should there be a printing cap? Heart = YES Like = NO "
# 3495 " Overheard in D2 A: what's the most embarrassing thing you've done in front of a crush? B: asked her out "
# 3493 " Here’s a question to the smart asses drafting the printing cap proposal: If the majority of the student population prints less than 500 pages, then why even enforce a printing cap? That’ll only adversely affect the few “outliers” who most probably print out their readings because they might have too many or because it hurts their eyes if/when they stare at a screen for too long. Honestly, this idea is blatantly ridiculous, inconsiderate and useless (because hey like you said, only a “few” outliers will be affected). Here’s an alternate solution: Put a printing cap of 500 pages. But, if you return the pages that you printed to some sort of recycling point on campus, then you get those number of pages back. It would discourage people from excessively printing, but would also allow for them to print in a sustainable way that doesn’t affect their education, which is as important as the environment. "
# 3492 " A girl I have a crush on asked me for help with her coding project during dead week. I said I'd be glad to, only trouble was...I didn't know the language it was supposed to be written in (though it had a lot of similarities to ones I'd worked with). So I spent the entire evening before the study session learning the language. And guess what? I managed to help her fix the problems in her code and turn the project in early. So now, even if I don't get laid, I've added another language to my arsenal. I see this as an absolute win. "
# 3491 " Dalia, You're such a beautiful human being inside and out. I wish you would see how positively you affect people around you! "
# 3490 " Seniors, every year around this time of year and the start of spring, loads of people get super stressed because they haven't got post-grad plans laid out, and they get asked about it 15 times a day. Yes, grad schools and some areas like finance, consulting etc will already be giving job offers, but most places looking to recruit don't do so long in advance, so will only actually start posting positions late on in the spring or even in the summer. Similarly, there's a lot of randomness in the searching process, and so many brilliant people from the class above you got rejected from tons of ""easier"" looking positions all year, to then pull off a dream position in August, September etc. 80'000 hours (which you should all be looking at for their job hunting advice) reckons success rates for competitive jobs are about 2-3%, so you will almost certainly need to take loads of rejections before landing anything. Admittedly, having the option to search for a while after graduation is a privilege not everyone has (PPTP can also buy you valuable searching time). But just because you don't have an offer or a plan sorted out yet, don't panic. Things may well not be clear even by graduation, but we promise things will materialise, and you're more than smart enough to succeed. "
# 3489 " Can we please not have printing caps. As someone who has to do a lot of reading, it literally hurts my eyes so much when I try to do it on a screen. I get the whole environment debate, but isn’t there a way where we can increase the amount of paper that gets recycled. That way, both the students and the environment will be happy. Like sure, save the planet guys but don’t come up with policy measures that significantly inconvenience large parts of the student body when there are good alternatives available. If you want to put a cap on something, why not to do it for the plastic bottles in D2 already? Why not ask Global Ed to change the rule of flying you back home after J-term if the gap is more than 3 days to save on CO2 emissions per head? Why not advertise cloth bags for Convenience store? Why not educate people about water use? Why not ask places on campus to not sell plastic cutlery? please, for the love of god, let me print my readings. "
# 3488 " I have always wondered when you sit in a large lecture hall, how many girls are bleeding from their periods because all girls look normal and not in pain and when you walk around our campus or library surely at least one girl you see today was on her period so she was in pain but every freaking girl I see including the hottest all look so normal and not in pain. Or take the girls that i see everyday on my floor and classes, surely once in having known and seen them they are on their period but not once have they looked abnormal like they are bleeding or in pain and cramps.

# 3483 " My girlfriend identified as bi for 2+ years until she came out as asexual a few months ago. I'm a straight guy, and I think sexual activity is important not only on a physical but also on an emotional level, especially in a long relationship (also it just feels really fucking good). She told me that she's still very sexually attracted to me (and we've been having sex even more if anything), but she doesn't feel sexually attracted to anyone else, guy or girl, which is valid given the spectrum of asexuality. She's going abroad next semester. Because she knows how much I like/value sex and since we can only rarely meet up, she proposed an open relationship, but since she's asexual, I'd be the only one fucking around with other people. I said no of course, but the fact that she even considered the option let alone ask me shows how strong, mature, and amazing my girl is. I fucking love her. "

# 3469 " Going off of the confession about a dick pic, when I was studying abroad this happened. I very much liked the guy I was in class with but unlike previous op we were talking and he was sat near me. It was midterms season and I was extremely distressed so I had to wank a lot to release tension. That day I did it before classes. When I finished I was running late to the class so I stupidly forgot to close a few pornhub windows before exiting the dorm. I came to the class, apologized for being late like a good girl (hehe) and locked my eyes with the guy I liked. I opened my laptop having no idea there’s a MASSIVE picture of a guy banging a girl with a huge cock. It was only a minute later when I realized I still had it on. The guy looked at it and then at me. In addition to my immediate embarrassment he never spoke to me again! "
# 3468
# 3467 " Freshman confession, “midterm season” is absolutely bullshit. There is no season. I had my first round of midterms around the same time and I’ve just continued to have midterms and midterm level assignments nearly every week since. It’s fine, I expected college to be difficult, especially here at NYUAD. I’m not complaining about having to work, but stop fucking deluding yourselves by calling it midterm season. it’s midterm year you fuckers. "
# 3466 " Okay, so here's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me at NYUAD: There was this one class where I always used to sit at the front row, and there was this guy who would always sit right behind me. One day in this class, I unlocked my electronic device to see if I had any new emails or whatever, and the first thing that pops up is this HUUUUUUUUUGE dick pic that I'd been rubbing my oyster to earlier that morning. I was too embarrassed to look back (although low-key laughing internally tbh) but I just KNOW that the guy behind me saw. I could literally feel his gaze on my back, and I can only imagine the effort it took him not to burst out laughing. I've barely ever spoken to this person, but I kinda feel like there's a special bond between us ever since, lmao. Oh, I almost forgot to mention: This was TWO YEARS ago, but it's so ridiculous and so epic at the same time that I remember it like it was yesterday. P.S.: To the guy from behind: If you remember this incident, feel free to shoot me a message and laugh at my stupidity openly. And sorry for the potential trauma I caused you, lol <3 "

It's too late in the semester to tell them and it would just be really awkward if they learned now so I try to leave the room when the conversations get too personal and try not to take what they say to heart because everybody gotta vent sometimes. They never asked what languages i know and i don't normally volunteer this information and they just kinda assumed what i know. It is kinda funny though because one of them told her parents a list of some of my bad habits and i stopped doing them all at once and she later called it divine intervention over the phone. "

# 3424 " To those who use the hand dryers in the public bathrooms, Please don't use them! I don't know if you already knew about this but hand dryers literally suck in fecal bacteria (a.k.a. poop germs) from the toilets and blow them out onto your freshly cleaned hands. This was news last year and I still can't believe the number of people still using those dirty dryers to undo their hand-washing. If there are paper towels available, use them! They are like the most sanitary way to dry your hands without the risk of germ contamination from those dryers. According to numerous research articles such as the Journal of Applied Microbiology and Harvard Health Publishing, paper towels were the most sanitary, with some articles saying how jet-air dryers were found to spread germs more than hot-air dryers, but both spread far more germs than regular paper towels. I understand that some people may think it will be more environmentally friendly to use those hand dryers, but there is research that states that paper towels and old hand dryers basically have the same environmental impact. I would not be saying this if our school was equipped with the latest hand dryers with HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters and eco-friendly hand-dryers since they won't be spreading those germs and are better for the environment. But this is unfortunately not the case for our school. I have seen countless times when I hear the annoying whirs and the sharp noises from those hand dryers that pollute both the hands and sensitive eardrums. If there are no paper towels available, then make sure to dry your hands with tissues or napkins (there are many available at cafés and lounges or have them ready in your backpack). Don't use your clothes since they would already be contaminated and you would most likely be simply transferring the germs to your clothes by making them wet. But make sure to dry your hands since moisture on skin will attract germs. So the next time you use the public restroom, please please please don't use those dryers! One paper towel will be enough for you to be clean and green. Stay clean bears! TL;DR: Hand dryers contaminate your hands with poop germs so use paper towels instead! - health person "
# 3423 " i just had a breakdown after spending the entire day in bed. i was just facetiming my mom when i just cant fake it anymore. i put on makeup, i dress cute, i make myself look perfect every day just to somehow trick myself into thinking that i am almost perfect too. balancing sleep, social life, grades, my on campus job, my major. i feel like shit. i think of myself so lowly while i have no reason to. i would spend 100s AED eating out and feel so guilty. my friend told me that someone was treating me so badly because they’re jealous of me. the first thing that popped into my mind was about what? how can someone possibly be jealous of me? what is there to like about me? i have five 4 unit classes including three hour long ones four times a week. i can only eat my packed lunch at a really weird time. so that’s 8-4pm gone. only two half hour breaks. then after class i go straight to work, that’s two more hours. then i’d go home. then attend a couple club meetings. then go to the gym every other day. then use whatever time i have left for school work. doing all that before 11pm so i can shower and go to sleep. this just cycles on and on. and at the end of every cycle i dread the next. at this point my tears wouldn’t stop. every inch of my body aches from my cold, my back condition, from my previous workout, from the people who had hurt me in the past and now, but mostly and especially from this breakdown. my mom started crying too. we both just set our phone down and wouldn’t stop crying. she started telling me how i should treat myself better and don’t be so hard on myself. how i shouldn’t worry about money and success. she started apologizing to me when the truth is i probably ruined her perfectly fine day by calling. but i’ve let myself down. i could be better. i know that. i’m being hard on myself because i know that despite i am doing a good job, i can do a better job. but it is burning me out. i don’t have enough energy. i’m just waiting for everything to be over. man it really sucks to have PMS because it actually makes you realize how awfully wrong your life is. -lonely girl "

# 3419 " Honestly I never thought having a boyfriend would be this great. I grew up seeing my parents argue a lot and I’ve witnessed dad being both physically and verbally being abusive to my mom. I was always scared to be in a relationship and often told people around me that I would never get married until I met my boyfriend now. He was one of my closest friends from high school and when he asked me out, I thought I would give it a try but wasn’t still sure about my decision. When I moved to cal I was having a really hard time making new friends and adapting my life here in general and cried a lot. One day I was on the FaceTime with him (we’re doing long distance) and I started crying because I was just really stressed. He didn’t talk much and was just looking at me and then I somehow fell asleep, not completely though where I could still hear what he was saying. After awhile, he didn’t hang up but asked quietly if I was asleep. 10 minutes passed and he asked me again if I was sleep but in even more quietly. Then he said, “goodnight, I love you” and hung up the call. I know I might be overreacting but him and I have never said I love you to each other and we’re both each other’s first bf/gf so it was my first time hearing it. He probably doesn’t know that I heard it and I find it super cute how he said it while I was asleep. I felt like all my anxiety and stress from school was healed that moment. Ahhhhhh I love you so much "
# 3418 " Please allow me to express my frustrations here: Why don’t we have a cap on the number of events each SIG can have throughout the semester? Over programming at this school is a huge issue. Why don’t we have a cap on the number of flyers/posters SIGs and other events in campus can put up? It’s seriously such a wast of paper and ink. Why don’t we have an extra ATM machine in the welcome center? It would save a lot of people time. Why are there like 12 workers at the convenience store and always only one guy actually working at the register? Why are the doors to the entrance at C2 automatic? At least one should be manual to save energy and people from breaking their arms/getting stuck in randomly closing doors. Why are people at GlobalEd so rude???

# 3413 " Hot take: Vegans and vegetarians are naive and drowning in their own privilege. I understand if you don't eat meat for religious reasons, but people who don't eat meat because they feel sad for animals lack a basic understanding of the food chain and natural selection. Humans eat meat for the same reason animals hunt other animals (we just do it more efficiently). To the second point, do you see any vegans in any of these third world countries? Is vegan food prohibitively expensive? The answer is yes to the second question. From what I have seen (obviously there is a flaw in this), every so-called 'vegan' person I know is either trying to lose weight without exercising or just a social justice warrior--I don't know what's worse. They've never been hungry--never starved almost to death. They've never had to grow up wondering when they're going to eat their next meal. My parents are immigrants in America. My Dad would talk about how he was so poor that he could only afford to eat one meal a day and meat was a luxury for only very special occasions. It is ridiculous that someone like these 'vegans' would get on their soapbox and lecture others on their lifestyles. That's what wrong with these liberal cucks who claim to know the "right" way to live. "

However, I come from a humble household and alleviating the financial situation of my family is my first and foremost priority. It's not like we're poor or anything, it's just that I need to pay back to my parents. The very fact that I speak English right now is directly due to some of their immense sacrifices. My career is kinda the turnout of their lifespan of hardships. I wouldn't mind eating canned beans under a bridge as long as I am doing something meaningful, but I need money and status for my parents. NYUAD, although fantastic, is a rather very recent school. I am afraid it still needs to prove its worth to the market. I read some posts about how the career development center is dormant and how scarce internships are. Besides, the emirati nationalization policy makes it harder and harder for weak passports like mine to land a job. Are my worries legitimate? Does NYUAD allow for entrance to the corporate world? Can any Alumni attest to that? Please don't wash me out as a corporate sellout. I am a comrade from birth to death. It's just that a smile on my mom's face matters more than the emancipation of all the nations of the world. Viva la revolución! " "

# 3364 " "Basic hygiene and bathroom etiquette on campus: 1. Shower at least once a day. Even if you've only stayed in your room the entire day, it's always best to rinse off the excess sweat on your body, especially around your private area and armpits. Oh, and brush your teeth twice every day. You can lie in your resume, but you can't lie to your dentist. 2. Wear a deodorant. This is so people don't have that uncomfortable look on their faces when they sit next to you. The rule of thumb is, if you have to sniff to ensure that you don't smell, well, it's likely that you do. So, spray that AXE. 3. Flush after you shit, esp in public restrooms. Make sure you wait three seconds to see if the shit is really gone. And if you see residue of your gold stuck on the bowl, use the hose to rinse that off as well. We do not need to see your personal art project. 4. For boys, lift the toilet seat before you pee. It's really not difficult. Your bladder can wait. 5. For girls, if you have your period that day and you're changing your pads and sit on the toilet, please wipe your blood stains off the seat. I know, periods are tough, but still, it's a public toilet. 6. If you really have to shit in a public restroom, lay a couple of paper towels on the seat so your skin doesn't have direct contact with it. Better yet, if you can bring a hand sanitizer and spray that all over, that'd make your shitting experience much more enjoyable. 7. If you're a loud shitter or a dairy-consuming lactose-intolerant person (shoutout to my fellow rebels), bring your phone with you to play some music. Not only will it reduce your anxiety, it will also make it more pleasant for those coming in unprepared for your beat drop. And yes, bring some cologne with ya. Spray that after you shit. 9. Wash your hands before leaving the bathroom. You and I both know that Aaron who never washes his after touching his pee pee. So, wash yours. Take a paper towel before you go and wrap that around the door handle before you walk out. 10. Lastly, don't make out in public bathrooms. Trust me, we know." "

I’m working at a pretty good company in a profession I’m excited about, but am constantly feeling unable to make friends or relate with my (much older) colleagues at work. As a student I struggled with depression and anxiety and I see it coming back now but don’t know how to talk to my boss about it or if I even should.

If I die early because of meat consumption, I'm no longer wasting resources, which is a huge environmental savings (for carnivores, why live the extra 30 beef-free years anyways, am I right?). Now, I can respect people who do have moral/religious reasons to not eat meat. But, I've always been told I always look super happy. The secret to all that happiness is meat.

# 3341 " I wish someone had made this clear to us when we got here: NYUAD does not give you hundred thousands dollars scholarship just for you to kick back and relax. NYUAD is not just another university; it's different. I hope we all bring the best from ourselves to show that when AOs made a choice of accepting us, they made the right choice. If you feel like you don't fit in, maybe you don't really deserve the scholarship. I'm not saying you should drop out, and I know that MENTAL HEALTH issue is real and can be as severe as physical health issue. So my advice is: take some and reflect, maybe take a gap year as well, take your time and don't stress yourself out. If you still don't feel like doing anything too great, drop out and BE YOURSELF. This university is inevitably trying to make you not to be you, and it's a lose-lose situation both for you and for this uni if you stay here. I know a shit ton of people who can make good use of this scholarship and actually make a difference. You don't need to come to NYUAD to be mediocre; we come here to excel. Go falcons go! "

If the people who you wrote down on your list had written down you on their list, then it would tell you that you've matched. If the other person didn't write you on that list, you'd never know if the person took the survey or not. Additionally, if you're curious, you'll get to know how many people think you're interesting but you won't learn their names unless you've matched.

Same for SRPP and Econ, God forbid you're a liberal arts major... I've seen so many Art majors sneer at other students' work. How can you guys treat your peers like this? Getting into NYUAD is hard, and we all know that succeeding here can be even harder. In light of this, why can't we be kinder to our own? I think a big part of the reason NYUAD gets fewer applicants than NYUNY is because the undergrads here live in a dog-eat-dog world. In the long run, being so openly cruel to your peers is tarnishing the reputation of our university. To everyone reading: I hope you were able to declare the major you wanted, and even if you weren't, I'm so glad you tried and that effort is probably going to serve you well in life. There are many paths to success, and you have the backing of an amazing institution behind you no matter what. The hierarchies you feel so strongly on campus are unknown to the world outside. Good luck out there, and GO Crushes & Compliments page! "

The way they feel that rush of bizarre superiority that they’re the only ones entitled to be stressed because of their curriculum is pathetic. Sure, the rigorous class schedules must be draining and the lack of electives must be very frustrating, nonetheless it was an informed choice on their part. On a different note, can students please stop comparing workloads to that of others in general? Midterms are coming up and unless one is underloading, everyone is equally stressed and exhausted. Frankly, it’s useless to attempt to find a mode of comparison to compare how more miserable you are than others; exams/projects and papers are challenging in different ways, each individual functions differently, and we are all looking forward to fall break at this point.

I don't remember your name but I really do hope you find your balance. I wish I could have said more to you but I really didn't know what else to say in the moment and I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable that a stranger was asking you about your problems, but I completely know what you mean. I'm writing this so hopefully by the time you see this it'll feel a little better looking back and seeing that you got through it. I didn't want to share it in the moment because I'm still kinda insecure about it but I was in the same position you were, and I always wished that someone would come up to me and ask me if everything was okay. this is my first semester back at NYUAD after withdrawing to take care of my mental health and i can tell you from experience that this place just makes you feel like you're never enough. but it's not true. we go out into the real world and everyone is SO impressed that were even here. that were studying to be productive citizens. that were in one of the BEST schools in the world. no one ever talks about how much this place fucks with your mental health and confidence. and it's a huge problem that I KNOW a lot of students suffer with because if you just look up once in a while and look at people's faces, everyone is just on autopilot. they're trying to get through the day and get home. that's it " "

I sincerely asked if you had another pen/color, and explained that in my culture [Chinese] it is extremely bad to write someone’s name in red because that means you are wishing death upon them. And the response I got was one of annoyance and disbelief, “well I don’t have one, so you don’t need to do anything”. You said it in front of other people, I got embarrassed, and proceeded to write my name. But this moment stuck in my head. Your cultural ignorance and purposely shunning another cultures beliefs upsets me. However, I’m mostly upset at myself for not confronting your discrimination towards another groups cultural practices. I will strive to never be embarrassed by my own culture in a place that should be accepting of everyone. Even though it may seem “weird” to you, respect it. "

I suddenly started to feel bad for that guy cos he could have lost a 40+ dirhams for not remembering to charge me, like you know, he did his job but lost money instead of earn it. And where I'm from, delivery guys don't earn a lot and usually work hard in bad conditions so I guess ir's probably the same case here.

I love them and they have supported me through most of my crisis'. They are people I would never turn a blind eye for. I had a solid friend group last year and I was happy for a while. However, I do feel that this is not reciprocated. One of my closest friends and I grew apart, partially my fault, I hold a lot of resentment for it. It doesn't help that things have gone worse for me this year, my friends go out to party without me, go off-campus without mentioning me and at times I find out from other people. It takes time for me to open up to people which doesn't make it easy for me to establish close friendships. I'm not on anyones line to go out or hang and I often initiate things with others. Only 1-2 of my close friends come over to my suite for me, most of the time its for my other (the best) suite-mates. I've begun to feel paranoid about myself as I feel that I don't have the qualities that make me interesting to be friends with. I've rarely been so insecure about myself.

But I'm sure you wouldn't hurt yourself if you properly covered your upper body (I hope this is understandable to girls). Simply, respect. "
# 3171 " Seriously what the fuck, I did not sign up here to have all the decently groomed guys with abs who don't smell like dick cheese just for them to be gay. Girls on campus put in so much more effort into looking presentable. I'm genuinely disgusted when I see non-lesbian couples together because clearly one person is getting the better deal. DEODERANT AND GROOMING IS THE BARE MINIMUM. I'm sick of waiting for study abroad to be able to hook up with New York students, it's just too much. Stop being ugly and do better. "

Also every single one of them dumped me but who's really winning the breakup? Watch out boys, steal and break my heart, I steal and break your job. "
# 3164 " I met you during Marhaba. I didn’t think I could have such a close relationship with someone, especially as an awkward freshman. Oh, how wrong I was. Before I knew it, we were practically inseparable. You were a great workout buddy. I sang the same songs you did. You were with me between classes. I helped you come out of your shell. I could listen to you for hours on end. I charged you up when you were low. That night was my fault. I should have paid more attention to you. I should have made sure you were okay. I shouldn’t have left you there, even if I said I would be back. I didn’t know that would be the last time. I spent the whole weekend trying to contact you, looking all over campus. I had hoped, against my rationale, that fate would have us cross paths again. I'm still hoping. Even now, I dream of finding you again. I wish one day you might feel the same. My dear AirPods, I never should have let you go. "

I’ve never loved anyone more in my life and I know she’s the one I'm going to marry.

# 3151 " We are just a bunch of entitled and super spoiled kids who believe they can get anything they want on campus. Come on, grow up! We do have tons of resources but that doesn’t mean we can always make the uni allocate them the way we (as individuals) want. The uni always tries to take care of everyone’s needs (at least in my experience), and if these seem super simple (ex. weighing scale in the gym) they might not be super simple to someone else. We don’t know of students’ stories and experiences with extreme levels of disorders/illnesses and we can’t just argue and demand the uni to reallocate the resources. This doesn’t only apply to the weighing scale issue, but many others such as dining halls, food, convenience store etc. Please be reminded that your student status differs a lot compared to those studying in your home countries and sometimes think about how ‘bad’ they feel when their chicken steak isn’t well-done but medium or their dining hall ran out of salmon or the convenience store doesn’t have their favorite ice cream flavor - MANY DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THESE THINGS, SO THEY PROBABLY FEEL AS BAD AS YOU DO.

# 3141 " After three long years of suffering from depression and anxiety, I am finally recovering. It feels like rebirth. I am more attentive to everything without even trying. I sleep well and my head does not feel heavy all the time. I care more about myself and I treat myself with small moments everyday. Because I did it. I found a way out of it. To all those who are going through a tough time, please remember that it will end. Please keep seeking for help and do not give up. There is no shame in seeing a counselor. It is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength. Our brains lie to us and sometimes they have the power to convince us that we are worthless. That is not true. We'll find a way out and we'll learn how to deal with our brains. We can do this!! <3 <3 "

# 3120 " To the freshies, Please don’t feel left out or like you don’t fit in if you don’t feel like you have found ‘your group’ after the first week of the semester. It’s the first week of the semester. I was a very outgoing person throughout freshman year, but only now, as a sophomore, I really feel a deep connection to people, like there are people that I feel like I can really be myself around (Partly because over time in college, you get to know yourself so much more as a person). But I was someone that found being comfortable with people difficult, it’s different for everyone. It will take time. And that’s not just about this university, it’s the same anywhere else. Believe in yourself. You got this. Side note: Seriously though, there are so many better places to meet people than parties. And make use of being able to meet people at the baraha as much as you can, because when the assignments and exams start, you won’t find a more quiet place on campus. Also, girls, please appreciate yourselves and take care of yourselves. Know your worth and don’t let anyone dare to treat you badly. This could be one of the most transformative years of your life. Make the best of it. "

If you think that there might be the slightest chance that a person is too far gone, uninterested, or just a tad uncomfortable, please stop yourself from going farther. Please listen if someone says no. Please don't coerce, don't guilt-trip, don't expect consent if not clearly communicated, even for the things you think are minute. Please, let us just get through one first weekend without others getting hurt. Please watch out for your friends, for your classmates and for your NYUAD family. "

# 3087 " Some advice for incoming freshmen: I look back at my freshman year and shake my head at how hard I tried to become friends with toxic people out of fear of being alone. Some people are straight up manipulative, but it’s easy to see through that when you’re eager to make new friends. Don’t get me wrong there are SO many incredible people on this campus and after I realized who my true friends are I wish I hadn’t given so much of myself to people who really didn’t care. (This goes for being in romantic/sexual relationships as well, just because it may seem like everyone is hooking up, does not mean you have to, SERIOUSLY) Don’t sweat about trying to get invited to every party or every gathering, your right friends will come along with time. Don’t let people take advantage of you. And if you happen to have a bad experience making friends know that there are still so many great people out there and take it as a learning experience. Also, we’re all going through our own things so don’t be quick to judge a person based off of your first impression of them. Wishing you all the best. "

If you know any NYUAD ‘19 women, whom you have silently and distantly looked up to/admired, please tag them and give a shout out. Tell them why.
